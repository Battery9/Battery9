### Kinda 'one-stop dev', they call it a Full Stack Developer. 🤷‍♂️

My job is a glorious mess: providing the vital supply (APIs) to my frontend buddies, or sometimes joining them to consume my *own* supply. I constantly switch between architecting database schemas and wrestling with cloud infrastructure to solve whatever end-to-end disaster is next.

2 years in, and I'm still asking: **What am I doing?** 😅 (But the code works, so it's good. ✅)
